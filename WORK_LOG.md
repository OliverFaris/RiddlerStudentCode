We were trying to do something with unicode |

| Aug 27 |       2hrs       |  I already had some code before for the first riddle but it wasn't working. Then class came and I realized I need to wrap around the alphabet! So I coded that and it worked. For the second riddle, I knew it was ascii but wasn't sure if I should use a nested for loop. Then I found out about the split function like in python and used it to solve the riddle. In the third riddle I immediatly just thought of a for loop but moving 8 bits at a time and it worked. I looked on google for how to turn binary to integers for that part. For the last part I was confused at first but I realized that the truck should be a space since it matched the frequency so I figured out the key by minusing 32 from the decimal of the truck emoji. After that it was simple to code the rest. |
